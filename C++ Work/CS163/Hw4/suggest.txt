 hash function should be private.

-2 Inconsistent indentation.  Put { on own line.

-6 Destructor doesn't delete keywords or the hash table array.  Only deletes the first node of each LLL.

-5 Insert should add one node to the hash table for each keyword.  The nodes should have pointers to the app data.  Add at the front of the LLL, don't traverse.

-6 Retrieve should find apps that have the same keyword and put them in a dynamically allocated array.

-1 Display should display all of the apps in the LLL that have the correct keyword.

-3 DisplayAll not implemented (the function called display_all doesn't).

-2 Seg fault on insert (you need to create the array of keywords before trying to add to it).
